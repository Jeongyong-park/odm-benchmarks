# Contributing to ODM Benchmarks

This page provides instructions for contributing to the ODM Benchmarks project.

## Review Benchmark Data

Have a look at [the existing benchmarks data](README.md).  It is organized by dataset.  This will give you an idea of the information needed.

## Select a Dataset

Choose and download one of the datasets listed in the first table [on the benchmarks page](README.md).  Links to the data are provided in the table. 

## Run the Dataset

Create a new task in ODM and process the images.
