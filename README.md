This repo contains the latest collected benchmark data for OpenDroneMap and WebODM.  

## Using The Benchmark Data

ODM benchmark data is organized two ways.

- [By Configuration](by-config.md) for a given configuration, how do different jobs perform?
- [By Dataset](by-dataset.md) for a given set of files, how does it perform under different configurations?
