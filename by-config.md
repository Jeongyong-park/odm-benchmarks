# Benchmarks By Config

This list shows benchmark data grouped by configuration.  Each configuration is described, and below it is a table listing data from various processing jobs.

## Using This Data

ODM benchmark data is listed two ways.  By configuration (this page) and [by dataset](by-dataset.md).

## Benchmark Data

|         Dataset |        Field 1 |    Field 2     |          Field 3   |   Field 4 |
| :-------------- | -------------: | -------------: | -----------------: | --------- |
|          Sample Dataset 1 |   0.00 |  0.00 |      ABC |  XYZ |
|          Sample Dataset 2 |   0.00 |  0.00 |      ABC |  XYZ |
