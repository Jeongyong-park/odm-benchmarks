# ODM Benchmarks Data Parser

This is a nodejs application for parsing the raw benchmarks CSV data.  Installation and use has not been heavily tested, but it should be as simple as:

* Check out this repo to a machine with recent-ish version of nodejs installed
* Navigate to this directory 
* `npm install`
* `node app.js`
* Then view the output files in `../data-parsed/*.txt`
